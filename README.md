The whole project is in the Feedback_Analysis.ipynb file. But, this file is not opening in github. However, this file could be downloaded and can be opened through Jupyter Notebook, VS code or Google Colab.
In this project we have use two datasets which are "Datafiniti_Amazon_Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products.csv" and "Datafiniti_Amazon_Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products_May19.csv". 
But, "Datafiniti_Amazon_Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products_May19.csv" file is too large to be uploadable in github. So, we have only uploaded "Datafiniti_Amazon_Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products.csv".
Also, we have provided a smaller version of our dataset "Sample_Amazon_Dataset".
